# Efficient coding

- [Efficient R programming (Gillespie & Lovelace)](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)

- Vectorization over loop

- Many native functions are already optimized

- Use profiler to gain insight

- `tidyverse` and `data.table` are your data carpentry friends

# Demo 1

Calculating moving average

- The `for()` loop way vs the `stats::filter()`

Download R script [here](demo1.R).

---

# Demo 2

Sometimes we rely on functions developed by someone else that does not support vectorisation.

For example:

- I want to convert malaria parasite prevalence from children 0 to 5 years old to 2 to 9 years old so that I can calculate expected incidence based on some equation fitted by someone.

- `ageStand` [package](https://github.com/SEEG-Oxford/ageStand) by Smith et al. (2007)

Download R script [here](demo2.R).

---

# Demo 3

For some applications in which reading in large tables and data manipulations are necessary, `tidyverse` and `data.table` provide superior efficiency vs base R.

Download R script [here](demo3.R).

# Pre-computing models and results

- Look back at Demo 2!

- Write out your workflow

- Analyze which part of your work flow can be stored or pre-calculated

- Budget your time

# Health facilities app

1. Load data (Negligible 🎈, ~0s)

2. Fit GAM model (Fast 🚀, <2s)

3. Ask user for new coordinates

4. Calculate new travel time based on new coordinates (Hmmm...🤔)

5. Produce new prediction using GAM (Fast 🚀, <1s)

6. Produce visualization (🤷)

---

# Health facilities app

1. ~~Load data~~

2. ~~Fit GAM model~~ Pop pre-fitted GAM (Negligible 🎈, ~0s)

3. Ask user for new coordinates

4. Calculate new travel time based on new coordinates (Luckily this is fast!)

5. Produce new prediction using GAM (Fast 🚀, <1s)

6. Produce visualization (🤷)

# Example of storing model

```{r}
library(mgcv)

set.seed(1314)
dat <- gamSim(2, 5000, scale=.5)$data
mod <- gam(y ~ s(x, z), data = dat)
```

---

# Example of storing model

```{r error=T}
mod

save("mod", file = "gam_mod.rda")
rm(mod)
mod
```

---

# Example of storing model

```{r}
load("gam_mod.rda")
mod
```

# Optimization in HF app

1. Pop pre-fitted GAM

2. How many HF to add?

3. Spatial optimization using Genetic Algorithm (VERY long time...😴)

4. Calculate new travel time based on coordinates (Fast enough...)

4. Produce new prediction using GAM (Fast 🚀)

5. Put `n` new optimized spots and corresponding results on the map

---

# Optimization in HF app

1. Pop pre-fitted GAM

2. How many HF to add?

3. ~~Spatial optimization using Genetic Algorithm~~ Read pre-optimized coordinates from CSV (Negligible 🎈)

4. Calculate new travel time based on coordinates (Fast enough...)

4. Produce new prediction using GAM (Fast 🚀)

5. Put `n` new optimized spots and corresponding results on the map

# Aedes mosquitoes abundance in Florida

Sometimes, prediction from model isn't that simple... and fast...

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/Yang2018.png")
```

GLMM: Zero-inflated Negative Binomial model with Site and County-level random effects

---

# Aedes mosquitoes abundance in Florida

Fit using `glmmTMB` package; `predict.glmmTMB()` takes extremely long time (~ 1 hour).

"Model" is essentially a bunch of estimated parameters.

--

1. Pop pre-fitted GLMM

2. Ask users for input

3. ~~Use `predict.glmmTMB()` to obtain predicted values (😴)~~ Pull the parameters out from GLMM object and calculate prediction ourselves using Monte Carlo (Fast 🚀).

4. Display predicted mean and CI

---

# Final random tips

- `sf` is generally faster than `sp` but sometimes `sp` works better together with `raster`

- High quality of shape files can take MUCH longer time to render in plots and/or leaflet. Consider "downgrading" it using, [for example](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/71094/reduce-the-resolution-of-a-shapefile-in-r-or-qgis-if-necessary), `gSimplify()` from `rgeos` package.


- Shock proof your code: Use `dplyr::filter()` and `dplyr::select()` instead of `filter()` and `select()`.

# COVID-19 Dashboard for Florida

"Nowcasting" of death by day of death


See the Shiny app [here](http://flcovis19.herokuapp.com/)


NOTE: This app is no longer in development since Sep 2020. The FL state data stream that powers this tool is no longer updated since June 2021.

--

The code that pulls and analyzes the data on daily basis no longer works because of change in data format since Apr 2021.

---

# COVID-19 Dashboard for Florida

On local computer

1. Scheduled to run script daily at 5pm

2. Pull data from state (100s MB)

3. Run model (Forever...)

4. Store results onto CSV

5. Push CSV to github

On Shiny app

1. Pull CSV from github

2. Make plots and display

# EFI Explorer

https://efi-members.herokuapp.com/


Want: A Shiny app that automatically *pulls a table of members*, *find the coordinates*, create a map using `leaflet` for display.


Problem: Geolocating via Google is not free, also want to avoid any authentication on our side.

---

# EFI Explorer

- Use Google Sheet to store/edit table

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/GoogleSheet.png")
```

- Use Google Apps Script to geolocate (Free!)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../assets/img/GoogleAppsScript.png")
```

- Ask Google to schedule the script on daily/weekly basis (Also free!)
